CVE-2025-40775
====================

Title: BIND Assertion Failure via Invalid TSIG Algorithm Name

CVE: CVE-2025-40775

Description:
When an incoming DNS protocol message includes a Transaction Signature (TSIG), BIND always checks it. If the TSIG contains an invalid value in the algorithm field, BIND immediately aborts with an assertion failure. This can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
